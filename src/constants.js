given migration matrix, according to Wilkinsion-Herbots (2003) and Slatkin (1991). The migration matrix
must be a squared, positive matrix with zeroes on the diagonal. The migration matrix must also be conservative,
meaning the sum of row i is equal to the sum of column i, for i = 1, 2, ..., n. If the migration matrix is not
conservative, a solution is not gurnateed! Go to "About Our Software" from the main menu for more information.`;
